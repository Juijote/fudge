# Fudge
This is a reverse-engineered alternative to Fujifilm's official WiFi app. The short-term goal is to serve as a simple photo gallery and downloader, and focus primarly on reliability.

## Improvements over XApp / Camera Connect
- Location and notification permissions are not required
- *Much* more responsive UI, with native design
- Gallery and image downloading is slightly faster

This app isn't finished yet, so don't set high expectations. Fuji's version of PTP/IP has many different quirks and features, so it's not easy to implement them all from
a single camera. Currently, it's only been tested on a few older cameras, but functionality for newer cameras will slowly be implemented (as well as bluetooth) over time.

Beta builds are published on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.danielc.fujiapp). The latest builds are also available on [F-Droid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/dev.danielc.fujiapp).
